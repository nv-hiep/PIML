**Data and Analysis Notebooks for Physics-Informed Inference**\
This document includes the model designs, data and analysis notebooks associated with the study entitled "Mapping cold and warm neutral hydrogen in galaxies with neural networks".
1) We use Neural Networks (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks, Transformers) to design HI self-absorption (HISA) detectors. These HISA detectors identify HISA features in HI emission spectra, and extract their velocities.
2) We develop Physics-Informed Inference (PII) frameworks to infer HI gas temperatures from emission data alone.
